# Installing
If the user is running this app directly from the source code, I sugggest they
create a virtual enviornment with the command
```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Refer to (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?highlight=venv#module-venv)
for more information.

- After a virtual enviornment is created and ACTIVAED, Install the desired
python modules by executing the following instruction from the command line inside the
MealMixer folder. There should be a requirements.txt file there.
```
python3 -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
# Program Execution
from one folder above the meal-mixer package execute the following command
```
python3 meal-mixer
